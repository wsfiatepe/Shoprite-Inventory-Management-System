# Shoprite-Inventory-Management-System
This inventory management system is a small Windows 7+ WPF software application to manage inventories where items are purchased on a regular basis. It runs on the .NET 4.7.1 framework and uses a SQLite database for data storage. This inventory management system was built for a big retail shop called ShopRite for use in the stores.
